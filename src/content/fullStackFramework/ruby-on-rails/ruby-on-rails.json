  "description": "Ruby on Rails, often simply referred to as Rails, is a highly opinionated web framework built using the Ruby programming language. Rails follows the convention over configuration (CoC) principle, meaning that developers can follow established best practices with minimal setup, speeding up the development process. The framework is known for its full-stack capabilities, handling everything from routing and database interactions to frontend rendering via its templating engine. Rails includes ActiveRecord, a powerful ORM, and encourages RESTful architecture, making it well-suited for building APIs. Its ecosystem includes a rich collection of gems (plugins) that extend functionality, allowing developers to add features like authentication, testing, and payment processing with ease. Rails is a great choice for developers who value developer happiness, rapid iteration, and building scalable applications with less boilerplate code.",
